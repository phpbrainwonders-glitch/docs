## Step 2: Learn the Testing Workflow

Every test follows a predictable lifecycle from start to finish.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gears" title="1. Registration">
    Users reach the school’s registration page and fill out required details.  
    School admins can customize fields, titles, and instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="2. Payment (Optional)">
    If payment is enabled, users complete the transaction before starting the test.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="book-open" title="3. Test Execution">
    Users read instructions, take the test, and submit responses.  
    Superadmins control test structure, sets, domains, and answer keys.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="link" title="4. Report & Links">
    - Test Link → sent when user registers  
    - Report Link → sent after test completion and processing  
    Reports can also be viewed by school admins.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
